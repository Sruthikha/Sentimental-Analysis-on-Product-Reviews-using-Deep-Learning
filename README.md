# Sentimental-Analysis-on-Product-Reviews-using-Deep-Learning
**INTRODUCTION**
The idea introduces an automated sentiment analysis framework tailored for E-commerce datasets. Leveraging a combination of Convolution Neural Networks(CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks(BiLSTM), the proposed model employs heuristic-based techniques to enhance the accuracy of sentiment classification.
The integration of CNN facilitates effective feature extraction from textual data, while BILSTM captures contextual dependencies and sequential patterns. 
The heuristic approach fine-tunes the model by incorporating domain specific knowledge, optimizing its performance for sentiment analysis in the context of E- commerce. 
Experimental evaluations on relevant datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in accurately discerning sentiments expressed in E- commerce reviews. The pre-processing steps for the input E-Commerce data are blank space removal, stop word removal, and stemming. 
Also, the word2vec features are also extracted. The method called “CNN with BiLSTM” is separately used which is named as OH-CNN-BiLSTM that performs the hybridization of two models for the sentimental analysis. 
The main idea used in this work is to develop an improved Galactic Swarm Optimization(IGSO) algorithm for improving the hybridized model, as it provides faster convergence and also solves optimization issues. 
The results highlight the potential of the CNN- BiLSTM model with heuristic enhancements as a robust tool for automated sentiment analysis in the dynamic and nuanced domain of E-commerce.
